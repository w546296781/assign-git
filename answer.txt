1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.
The following content should be in gitignore file for a Java project:
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs
hs_err_pid*

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest commit of the feature branch. This is a "fast forward."

3. Why should you have different branches?
Branches are what we need to solve these problems. Because a branch represents exactly such a context in a project and helps you keep it separate from all other contexts.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Only one at most time.
